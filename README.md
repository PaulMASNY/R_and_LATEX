# R_and_LATEX
R and Latex direct report writing with TexStudio.

In combination with GIT, this solution allows :

# 
* Group report writing through GIT branches and merges: Every change is controlled 
and tracked.

* Direct report writing: Datas, graphics and code listings are "one-way" compiled 
straight from your Latex document. 
Knitr will call R from TexStudio and compile your report on the go without copying-pasting.
